Christmas  V15/95
And now for the story of David Ciglar sentenced to 10 years charged with
marijuana cultivation. Before his arrest, David Ciglar was being retrained
in a new career as an MRI technician. He had been injured on his job as a
firefighter/paramedic as he was carrying a woman from a building. He has
been credited with saving over 100 lives. Based on a tip to the DEA, he was
caught with a plastic tray of small marijuana seedlings growing in his
garage.  His family home was seized.  Now the American taxpayers get to
financially support David, his wife, and his three kids.  Thank you DEA for
consistently violating our rights for over thirty years.

This song is about the life of a storm trooper under the command of Darth
Vader aboard the death star.

Alzheimer's...................... v22 s34 t150                  45-50

This song is about our self-destructive health care system.  When Medicare
was enacted in 1963, politicians estimated it’s cost in 1990 to be 3
billion dollars. The actual cost to taxpayers was 97 billion.

They say that love makes the world go round.  But without music, love
doesn’t stand a chance.  Whoops, did I say love?  I meant pizza.

Did you hear about that cop who just got off for killing that st. louis
mother of six.  They were doing a drug bust on her house and they mistook a
3-inch bolt for a weapon so they shot her.  We have to get these bastards
out of office.  I wonder if George Bush or AL Gore be better people today
if they had spent ten years in prison for their youthful indiscretions.

This song’s about an Ebola-like disease which causes it’s victims to go
into a series of convulsions, which equivocate into a dance known as the
get down. We also play children’s birthday parties and barmitzfahs.  Just
call Rory at 618-692-6252.

We know how rough it can be being a teen sometimes. I used to get pretty
down about it myself and so did Rory, but my friends taught me a thing or
two that made me feel lots better. Wrote a song about it.  Like ta hear it?
Here it go.

This next song brings to mind an animal, which is deep-fried quite often.
The chicken.  Did you know that the life of the average battery hen
consists of complete restriction of movement, toxic ammonium oxide gases,
throat blisters, mouth ulcers, chronic pain from debeaking, prolapsed
uteruses, osteoporosis, and a lovely outing to the slaughterhouse.   So,
for the love of god, only buy free-range eggs!  They’re available at
shnucks or on private farms.  Oh yeah, this song’s called Why You Gotta
Deep Fr¥ My Heeart.  It’s about this lady who kept deep frying my heart.

This next one’s an ode to the last surfing rabbi in existence.  Sometime on
a clear rosh shashana’s eve you can still see him riding the curl on the
Red Sea.

Chlorophyll Deficiency .v31 s09 t130                     67-68

This song’s about the very special time in the tree’s life when it is
drained of it’s chlorophyll and it dies for a season.  I love this time
because trees and forests are taking over our communities.  This inferior
life forms should not be allowed to waste useful space in our advanced
society.  They’re taking over.

After song: But the fun doesn’t have to end here. You can purchase our
fabulous record, “Radioactive Moonflower”.  It even comes with a sticker
and a free plutonium rod.  These prices are so low, you’ll think we’ve
suffered brain damage.  Hours and hours of fun for ages 1 through 5. We got
t-shirts too.
