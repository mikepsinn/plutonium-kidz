Christmas  V15/95
And now for the story of David Ciglar, sentenced to 10 years for marijuana
cultivation. He has been credited with saving over 100 lives. Based on a
tip to the DEA, he was caught with a plastic tray of small marijuana
seedlings growing in his garage.  His family home was seized.  Now, for the
next ten years, American taxpayers get to financially support David, his
wife, and his three kids.  Thank you DEA for consistently violating our
rights for over thirty years.

This song is about our self-destructive health care system.  When Medicare
was enacted in 1963, politicians estimated it’s cost in 1990 to be 3
billion dollars. The actual cost to taxpayers was 97 billion.

This next song brings to mind an animal, which is deep-fried quite often.
The chicken.  Did you know that the life of the average battery hen
consists of complete restriction of movement, toxic ammonium oxide gases,
throat blisters, mouth ulcers, chronic pain from debeaking, prolapsed
uteruses, osteoporosis, and a lovely outing to the slaughterhouse.   So,
for the love of god, only buy free-range eggs!  They’re available at
shnucks or on private farms.  Oh yeah, this song’s called Why You Gotta
Deep Fr¥ My Heeart.  It’s about this lady who kept deep frying my heart.

This song’s about the very special time in the tree’s life when it is
drained of it’s chlorophyll and it dies for a season.  I love this time
because trees and forests are taking over our communities.  This inferior
life forms should not be allowed to waste useful space in our advanced
society.  They’re taking over.
