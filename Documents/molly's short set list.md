They say that love makes the world go round.  But without music, love
doesn’t stand a chance.  Whoops, did I say love?  I meant pizza.

This song’s about an Ebola-like disease which causes it’s victims to go
into a series of convulsions, which equivocate into a dance known as the
get down. We also play children’s birthday parties and barmitzfahs.  Just

We know how rough it can be being a teen sometimes. I used to get pretty
down about it myself and so did Rory, but my friends taught me a thing or

Here it go.

This next one’s an ode to the last surfing rabbi in existence.  Sometime on
a clear rosh shashana’s eve you can still see him riding the curl on the
Red Sea.
