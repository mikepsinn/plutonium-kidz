I pledge allegience to the kidz

Of the united states of plutonium.
And to the rocking for which they stand
One nation under Rod, invisible
With liberty and justice for all…white males ages 18 to 32

I pledge allegience to the flag
of the United States of America
and to the country for which it stands
one nation under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all.

In 1903, the average taxpayer forked over 3% of his income.  Today, 49% of
the work you do is stolen from you through income tax, sales tax, and many
other hidden costs that these career politicians slip into every corner of
our lives.

They say that love makes the world go round.  But without music, love
doesn’t stand a chance.  Whoops, did I say love?  I meant pizza.

two that made me feel lots better. Wrote a song about it.  Like ta hear it?
