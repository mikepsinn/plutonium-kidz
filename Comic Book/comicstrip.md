Molly and Super Dude

N:  “Now if you could spare us a few more moments of your precious
consciousness, I’d like to relate the story of the conception of the
Plutonium Kidz.  Since different people prefer to receive information via
different sensory pathways, I’ve taken the liberty of streaming this tale
through your optic nerve as well as your acoustic one.  If you look at the
comic book that came with this record, you will notice a number in the
corner of each square.  This number refers to the track, which contains the
auditory accompaniment for that particular box’s events.  When you hear the
sound <beep>, it is time to turn you eyes to the next square.  Now if there
are no questions let us begin with the sunset of the lives of Molly
Fantastique and Super Dude.”

extremities, I’m suffering from severe radiation poisoning.’  I could be
playing golf right now.  Did you ever consider that?”

her of another malady… her life!”

demographic!  

Mike:  That’s me!

Dr. Hamilton: Would you care for some assorted glucose flavored
foodstuffs?”

Mike:  “I don’t know..”

Dr. Hamilton: “You can trust me.  What sort of ignoramus would use that
tired old cliché to abduct random children?”

Mike thinks: “I guess you’re right.  That line went out with the Catholic
faith.  However, these characters do look rather unsavory… but their candy
appears rich and delicious!”

[Gate of RAD Lab]

N:  “He is then abruptly whisked away to the most secret of unknown,
enigmatically clandestine, mysterious, and quite hush hush, hidden
radiation testing facilities under the command of the evil Dr. Hamilton.
We can only imagine the fear pulsing through Rory’s veins.”

Rory: “I like candy.”

(Mike is driven to a top-secret human radiation-testing lab.  The van
enters a heavily restricted area with big building and barbed wire and a
guard.)

Carnahan:  “Mornin’, Dr. H.”

Dr. Hamilton says to guard: “How are you faring this day, Carnahan?  Would
you like me to ask you any other questions for which I do not care what the
answers are?”

Carnahan replies: “No that won’t be necessary.  I was just gonna babble
incessantly regardless.  Turns out the wife is gonna press charges after
all.  What’s more, the tests came back on that biopsy. Malignant.  After
the surgery, I’ll only be half a woman.  No man will want me. But other
than that, everything’s coming up roses.  Whoa! (noticing mike) I’m glad
I’m not in that kid’z shoes.”

Dr. Hamilton:  “Shut up” *like Karl tells Lenny

Wonderwhirl: “It’s me, Molly Fantastique!”

(BAM!  Pow!  Jism!)

Soldiers:  “OK, boss.  This sword’s gonna kill ‘em, skin ‘em, and serve as
the spit revolving them over an open fire.”

Dr. Hamilton:  “You fools.  I want those mutants in one piece as well as a
full report documenting the delicious details of their physical agony.  We
have to make this look like a legitimate experiment or those movie stars on
Capitol Hill will take away our funding.”

(the end of a book that says Fin)

Once upon a time Wonderwhirl’s parents (past tense verb) over  to
Fredrick’s Music Lounge.  They were wearing kitten skin (article of
clothing), which was the style of the time.  Then, all of a sudden, Grandma
Kay (past tense verb) a whole lot of people. Among them were Will Broadway
and John Mossman.  To avenge this, Paul Mossman put itching powder in
Molly’s Parent’s clothes. They put them on and were outraged to discover
that someone had put itching powder in their clothes. Since revenge is a
dish best served cold.  They decapitated John and Maija putting each head
into its own individual milk bottle.  Later at an auction, Mike P. Sinn and
Molly Stewart Anderson purchased these bottles for one American dollar.
They promptly delivered these heads to the honorable Jeffery Hess who was
preparing refreshments for his birthday party at the Skate Corral. JJ
Murphy, Rob Sinn, Jason Potter, and Tom Plunk had been wistfully dreaming
of this party for months.  These two heads were simply not enough to
satiate the appetite of four growing boys. Looking to the heavens for some
sort of answer, they spied a Rainbow and followed it to the Way Out Club.
To their astonishment they found that this was merely a front for a
sweatshop where 4 year olds Sara Downey and Thomas Eversmann painstakingly
make the entire line of Converse shoes.  Little did they know, a sting
operation was already in place, having been masterminded by the crime-
fighting duo of Paul Starks and Matt Chandler.  Then Thomas Miller killed a
whole lot of people.
