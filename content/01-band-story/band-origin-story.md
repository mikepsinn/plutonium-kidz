In a Massachusetts school, seventy-three disabled children were spoon-fed
radioactive isotopes with their morning oatmeal... Wonderwhirl was created.
In upstate New York, an eighty-year old woman, believing she was being
treated for a pituitary disorder, was injected with plutonium by government
doctors.. Molly Fantasatique was born. Thousands of human radiation
experiments, many with no pharmaceutical benefit, were paid for with tax-
dollars. Mikey, the mild-mannered lawn boy, was thus transformed into...
Rory Rocket. Our powers combine to create the musical mega-force known
as... The Plutonium Kidz. Inspector Wong is a minister of propaganda, paid
to keep our identities a secret.
