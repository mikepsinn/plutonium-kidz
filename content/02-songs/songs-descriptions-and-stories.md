Chlorophyll Deficiency .v31 s09 t130                     67-68
 3:40
  Clean
This song’s about the very special time in the tree’s life when it is
drained of it’s chlorophyll and it dies for a season.  I love this time
because tree’s and forests are taking over our communities.  This inferior
life forms should not be allowed to waste useful space in our advanced
society.  They’re taking over.

Get Down
This song’s about an Ebola-like disease which causes it’s victims to go
into a series of convulsions, which equivocate into a dance known as the
get down. We also play children’s birthday parties and barmitzfahs.  Just
call Rory at 618-692-6252.

Surfin' Rabbi
This next one’s an ode to the last surfing rabbi in existence.  Sometime on
a clear rosh shashana’s eve you can still see him riding the curl on the
Red Sea.

Pukin' with Delight
We know how rough it can be being a teen sometimes. I used to get pretty
down about it myself and so did Rory, but my friends taught me a thing or
two that made me feel lots better. Wrote a song about it.  Like ta hear it?
Here it go.

Man in the Moon
This song’s and ode to that guy who works in the center of the moon,
controlling it’s orbit around the earth.  It’s gotta be really boring
pulling all those levers for eternity

Plutonium
They say that love makes the world go round.  But without music, love
doesn’t stand a chance.  Whoops, did I say love?  I meant pizza.
