Deep Fry:  This song goes out to all the girls I've ever stalked.  And I
think I know who you are.

Rory:  Nietzsche once said, ”without music, life would be a mistake.”
However, much the same could be said of suicide/Bob Saget/ALF.
Now molly will translate my previous anecdote for the English-impaired
members of our audience.
Molly:   Hay a guchi hahahaha!

You might notice the absence of the other 3 nuts who used to bang on their
instruments out here with me.  I'm sorry to say that their radiation
sicknesses have finally taken their toll and they no longer reside within
the realm.  But the nice thing is that I finally have the room to put my
seat all the way back on the drives out here.

We are now preparing for takeoff, so please fasten your seatbelts and
return you seats and tray tables to their upright position.  After we reach
cruising altitude, the captain will turn off the seatbelt light and you
will be free to move about the cabin.  This is a no smoking flight and
tampering with the lavatory smoke detectors is prohibited by law.

My primary prerequisite in a woman is the absence of male gentalia... and
even there, I'm flexible.

But seriously, I love homos.  Most of my boyfriends have been gay.


I pledge allegience to the kidz

Of the united states of plutonium.
And to the rocking for which they stand
One nation under Rod, invisible
With liberty and justice for all…white males ages 18 to 32

I think we've all learned something tonight.  You see shooting up heroin
may be glamorous and take you to a place more pleasurable than true Nirvana
could ever be but you've gotta realize it's just an escape from your
excruciatingly monotonous life, your dead end job, the irritating spouse
you settled on because you couldn't get anybody more attractive. So kids,
learn to respect yourself enough to say no to hardcore opiates and say yes
to the anti-drugs: friends, your favorite sport, or PCP.

Wouldn't it be nice if every mother to be had to look into the eyes of a
homeless Taiwanese 3-year old girl and say, "Eh, I’d rather have a white
baby."

I've decided to embrace a life of material enlightment and cast off the
chains of the spiritual world.

Will you shut up.  I was gonna go straight into another song but it’s kinda
hard to do with all this racket!  Bunch a god-damn trained monkeys.  I'm
really impressed you know how to put your hands together.  No, I'm just
playin.  Pretending to enjoy something that you didn't enjoy is a valuable
life skill.

I'm just fuckin around.  I love every one of you.  It's purely physical of
course.  But my love for you is so great that I'm going to tattoo every one
of your names on my body to eternally commemorate my passion.  Well not
really eternally.  Just until my flesh decomposes.


Are you mentally handicapped?  Yeah, me, too.  Being retarded, most music
produced by the industry today is way over my head.  Ambiguous lyrical
content full of confusing symbolism and too many musical notes just make me
want to go to the grocery store, touch people inappropriately and generally
make people uncomfortable.   So I’ve never really found a CD that didn’t
exceed my prerequisite quantity of intellectual con tent… Until now.  The
Plutonium Kidz LP, Radioactive Moonflower, contains just the asininity I
need to get these Velcro shoes a tappin’! I have always hoped that one day
we may get their entire collection of music released on compact disc.
Where else can you get all the Plutonium Kidz greatest hits on one compact
disc?  No COD’s. Enjoy this collection and share it with some friends. It
will bring back fond memories and great conversation.  Rediscover the
unforgettable sounds of the 1960s and 1970s; the bold, brilliant and
immortal music that rocked the world and moved an entire generation.
