Thank you Bob-O and Sherry-O for working so hard to provide us with a great
place like the WayOut.  So go over to the bar and buy some of their liquid
happiness.

This song is about our self-destructive health care system.  When Medicare
was enacted in 1963, politicians estimated it’s cost in 1990 to be 3
billion dollars. The actual cost to taxpayers was 97 billion.

My sister wanted me to do a little advertising for her personal business.
Her name is Jenny and she boasts that your house will be cleaner than that
of a methamphetamine addicted germophobe.  By not reporting any of her
income to the IRS, she can pass the savings on to you…so don’t delay call
692-6252 today. You’ll be smiling and so will your pocketbook.

Did you hear about that cop who just got off for killing that st. louis
mother of six.  They were doing a drug bust on her house and they mistook a
3-inch bolt for a weapon so they shot her.  We have to get these bastards
out of office.  I wonder if George Bush or AL Gore be better people today
if they had spent ten years in prison for their youthful indiscretions.

This next song brings to mind an animal which is deep-fried quite often.
The chicken.  Did you know that the life of the average battery hen
consists of complete restriction of
movement, toxic ammonium oxide gases, throat blisters,  mouth ulcers,
chronic pain from debeaking, prolapsed uteruses, osteoporosis, and a lovely
outing to the slaughterhouse.   Oh yeah, this song’s called Why You Gotta
Deep Fr¥ My Heeart.  It’s about this lady who kept deep frying my heart.

This song’s about the very special time in the tree’s life when it is
drained of it’s chlorophyll and it dies for a season.  I love this time
because tree’s and forests are taking over our communities.  This inferior
life forms should not be allowed to waste useful space in our advanced
society.  They’re taking over.

After song: But the fun doesn’t have to end here. You can purchase our
fabulous record, “Radioactive Moonflower”.  It even comes with a sticker
and a free plutonium rod.  These prices are so low, you’ll think we’ve
suffered brain damage.  Hours and hours of fun for ages 1 through 5.
