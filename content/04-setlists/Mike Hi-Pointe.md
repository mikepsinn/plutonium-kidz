I pledge allegience to the kidz

Of the united states of plutonium.
And to the rocking for which they stand
One nation under Rod, invisible
With liberty and justice for all…white males ages 18 to 50

I’m not afraid of insects taking over the world , and you know why? It
would take about a billion ants just to aim a gun at me, let alone fire it.
 And you know what I’m doing while they’re aiming at me? I just sort of
slip off to the side, and then suddenly run up and kick the gun out of
their hands.

If your’re in a war, instead of throwing a hand grenade at some guys, throw
one of those little baby-type pumpkins. Maybe it’ll make everyone think of
how crazy war is, and while they’re thinking, you can throw a real grenade.

If aliens from outer space ever come and we show them our civilization and
they make fun of it, we should say we were just kidding, that this isn’t
really our civilization, but a gag we hoped they would like. Then we tell
them to come back in twenty years to see our real civilization. After that,
we start a crash program of coming up with an impressive new civilization
either that or just shoot down the aliens as they’re waving good-bye.

If I was a father in a waiting room, and the nurse came out and said,
“congratulations, it’s a girl,” I think a good gag would be to get real mad
and yell, “A girl!? You must have me mixed up with that dork!” and point to
anther father.

Whenever you see an old lady slip and fall on a wet sidewalk, your first
instinct is to laugh. But think about it, what if you were an ant, and she
fell on you. Then it wouldn’t seem quite so funny, would it wise guy?

When I was a child, there were times when we had to entertain ourselves.
And usually the best way to do that was to turn on the TV.

If I lived back in the wild west days, instead of carrying a six-gun in my
holster, I'd carry a soldering iron. That way, if some smart-aleck cowboy
said something like "Hey, look. He's carrying a soldering iron!" and
started laughing, and everybody else started laughing, I could just say,
"That's right, it's a soldering iron. The soldering iron of justice." Then
everybody would get real quiet and ashamed, because they had made fun of
the soldering iron of justice, and I could probably hit them up for a free
drink.
