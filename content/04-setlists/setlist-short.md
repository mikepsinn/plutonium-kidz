## Mike's Version

Thank you Bob-O and Sherry-O for working so hard to provide us with a great
place like the WayOut.  So go over to the bar and buy some of their liquid
happiness.

This song is about the life of a storm trooper under the command of Darth
Vader aboard the death star.

Alzheimer's...................... v22 s34 t150                  45-50
         2:00
This song is about our self-destructive health care system.  When Medicare
was enacted in 1963, politicians estimated it's cost in 1990 to be 3
billion dollars. The actual cost to taxpayers was 97 billion.

Plutonium........................ v93 s29 t165                  10-15

Did you hear about that cop who just got off for killing that st. louis
mother of six.  They were doing a drug bust on her house and they mistook a
3-inch bolt for a weapon so they shot her.  We have to get these bastards
out of office.  I wonder if George Bush or AL Gore be better people today
if they had spent ten years in prison for their youthful indiscretions.

Get Down ...........................v27 s45 t105              56-58
        3:20

This next song makes us all pretty emotional.  It's about… It's about 3
minutes long.

Deep Fry My Heart.........v90 s07 t190                    6-9
     1:45

This next song brings to mind an animal which is deep-fried quite often.
The chicken.  Did you know that the life of the average battery hen
consists of complete restriction of
movement, toxic ammonium oxide gases, throat blisters,  mouth ulcers,
chronic pain from debeaking, prolapsed uteruses, osteoporosis, and a lovely
outing to the slaughterhouse.   Oh yeah, this song's called Why You Gotta
Deep Fr¥ My Heeart.  It's about this lady who kept deep frying my heart.

Surfin' Rabbi.................. v22   s69   t175                62-66
         2:50
      d6edge

Chlorophyll Deficiency .v31 s09 t130                     67-68
 3:40
  Clean
This song's about the very special time in the tree's life when it is
drained of it's chlorophyll and it dies for a season.  I love this time
because tree's and forests are taking over our communities.  This inferior
life forms should not be allowed to waste useful space in our advanced
society.  They're taking over.

After song: But the fun doesn't have to end here. You can purchase our
fabulous record, "Radioactive Moonflower".  It even comes with a sticker
and a free plutonium rod.  These prices are so low, you'll think we've
suffered brain damage.  Hours and hours of fun for ages 1 through 5.

They say that love makes the world go round.  But without music, love
doesn't stand a chance.  Whoops, did I say love?  I meant pizza.

This song's about an Ebola-like disease which causes it's victims to go
into a series of convulsions, which equivocate into a dance known as the
get down. We also play children's birthday parties and barmitzfahs.  Just
call Rory at 618-692-6252.

Thanks to all of you for coming out tonight!  We're so lucky to have so
many great people in st. Louis to come out and pay attention to us.

We know how rough it can be being a teen sometimes. I used to get pretty
down about it myself and so did Rory, but my friends taught me a thing or
two that made me feel lots better. Wrote a song about it.  Like ta hear it?
Here it go.

This next one's an ode to the last surfing rabbi in existence.  Sometime on
a clear rosh shashana's eve you can still see him riding the curl on the
Red Sea.
